## Release Process
Quark's release process is mostly automated. Here's the steps:

1. Pull master so you're up to date, make sure everything is committed
2. Run `git tag -a release-<mc_version>-<build_number>`. If you don't know or remember what those are, look at `build.properties`
3. In the editor that pops up, write the changelog
4. In `build.properties`, increment the build_number by one for the next version. Commit this.
5. Push master and the release tag: `git push origin master release-<mc_version>-<build_number>`
6. Shortly after, the mod should be automatically uploaded to GitHub's release tab, Modrinth, and CurseForge.

## Signing
Releases are signed with the Violet Moon signing key, see [this
